# Song-association
- My HawkHack project. Uses speech recognition to create a song association game.
- A song-assosiation game is played by giving the user a word and having them sing a song based on that word
- my first ever hackathon project
- One of my first "larger" projects

# How it was built
- It was built using the Speech Reconginiton python library 
- It was built using python kivy for the Ui
- Pyaudio was used for the handeling of auido 

# How it is continuing to be built
- Currently working on version which use customTkinter for the UI 
- Currently working on a version that includes pyGame 
- Currently using Beatuful Soup for webscraping in order to get lyric data

# What is next 
- Aim to incorpoate better speech recongition to track user singing with greater efficiency
- Aim to transistion the score checking system to be less reliable and user based by allowing the searching of lyrical data 
- In order to do this we must find an efficent mehtod of searching the lyrical data so we can find a song match in a timely manner
- This means the creation of a backend must be done down the line
- Down the line a full backend will become more necessary
- Aim to incorporate multiplayer features 
- Aim to use machine learning to optimize both the singing and song finding aspect of the game
